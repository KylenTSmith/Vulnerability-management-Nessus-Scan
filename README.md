# Vulnerability Management Using Nessus Scan

![Vulnerability Management Nessus Scan](https://i.imgur.com/07Lb9rn.png)

## Introduction

In this project, I will cover vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation. These are two of the main steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. I will be using Nessus Essentials to scan local VMs hosted on VMWare Workstation in order run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation. 

- VMWare (Virtual Machine)
- Windows 10 (PLatform Used)
- Nessus Essentials (Vulneralbitity Management Scanner)


## First Nessus Scan (No credentials)

## Configuring VM for Credential Scan

## Turning on file and printer sharing

## Turning off user account control

Of course in the real world you dont want to do this, this is only solely contrusted inside the virtual machine for this project.

## Scan after installing depricated firefox

(Before this I installed an super older version of firefox on the VM.)

## Starting the process of remidiating the vulnerabilities

In this step will begin to remidiate some of the vulnerabilites by unistalling the old firefox and updating windows in the VM.

Again, in the real world you never want to install and older version of anything. It can lead to vulnerable patches and bugsand software updates that arent protected and hardened like the newer verions.

In conclusion, this is a step by step that most pen testers or any type of vulnerability management team will do to get a scope of the vulnerabilities of a siglne machine/host on a network. Its other and more effienct ways to do a scan especially with a bigger and broader network but in this project it was only just for a single machine/host.
